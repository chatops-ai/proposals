## Contributing

`chatops.ai` is still in its infancy, and welcomes contributions of any kind - feature requests, standards proposals, documentation edits. 

You can join the slack community by visiting http://chatops.lol/. We also have a GitHub team for contributors! Once you've gotten a PR merged in, notify anyone from the `og` team and they'll add you as a contributor.

Have fun! ðŸ¤–
